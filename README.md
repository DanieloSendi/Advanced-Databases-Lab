# AdvancedDatabases_Lab

The repository was dedicated to familiarizing with SQL databases and the SQLAlchemy library through a series of lab tasks. The final goal was to create a project that included a program generating and reporting data at regular intervals. The scripts were executed automatically through tasks created in the Windows Task Scheduler. The database was provided by AGH.
